* **Baker Hughes, Mumbai**

  I started working here after my undergrad, since July 2019. I am working in the [Aspire Leadership Program(Engineering & Technology)](https://careers.bakerhughes.com/global/en/aspire) as a Software Engineer. This is Baker Hughes' highly selective program. This program demands higher responsibilities, leadership, and direct exposure to company stakeholders. I have performed business requirement analysis and execution of various projects based on cloud-computing, industrial analytic models and on-cloud deployments. Also as a part of this program, I have accomplished multiple leadership as well as technical trainings, with one at Housten,TX. I have also accomplished a novel idea based on deployment of Analytic models and have filed a patent as lead inventor with Baker Hughes at the USPTO. Additionally, I have also been a co-inventor for a patent based on artifact management which is in process of filing at multiple countries.
